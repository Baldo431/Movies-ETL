# Movies-ETL

## Purpose
Gather data about movies from both Wikipedia and Kaggle, combine them, and save them into a SQL database. This data must be clean and workable enough to be provided in a hypothetical hackathon. To do this, an ETL process will be followed by extracting the Wikipedia and Kaggle data from their respective files, then transforming the datasets by cleaning them up and joining them together, and fingally loading the cleaned datasets into an SQL database.

## Deliverables
1. Write an ETL Function to Read Three Data Files
2. Extract and Transform the Wikipedia Data
3. Extract and Transform the Kaggle data
4. Create the Movie Database
